is an amazing story about excelling through hard work and a lot of ambition that crosses the generations of the Whittard family.</p>

            <h2 class="article_subtitle">A story that crosses generations of Whittard's</h2>
            <br> <br>
          <p class="article_paragraph">I all started in 1886 when Walter Whittard quit his family leather business and he decided to start his own business at only 25 years old. He had a good eye for business and in short time he was known for the qualitative coffee and tea that he was selling at his shop in London.
<br> <br>
In 1935 Walter died and his sons, Dick and Hugh, started to lead the business and their father’s philosophy to “buy the best” firmly entrenched in their minds. So there was no place for low quality products.
<br> <br>
In 1939 war was declared, and a year later a bomb struck the Whittard warehouses during the blitz. But the brothers found quickly a solution, and in 1941 they found a new place to move their entire business – the shop, headquarters, warehouse and coffee roastery – CHELSEA.
              <br> <br>
1999: As the new millennium brought promise of new beginnings, we were celebrating a new beginning of our own- the new flagship store in Covent Garden, filled with loose leaf tea, aromatic coffee, creative hot chocolate and instant tea.
<br> <br>
Walter was a tradition-breaker with no time for compromise: he was never afraid to try something new, so the results of his efforts have big proportions nowadays. The business was extended all around the world, but especially in Europe. Now you can buy their products online from every corner of this world, and this is only due to Whittard’s generations ambition.
